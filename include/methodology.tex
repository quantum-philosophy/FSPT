In this section, we describe the workflow of the proposed methodology along with
the core ideas and models that the methodology is based on. Although our work is
closely related to simulation techniques, what we do is synthesis, not
simulation, which will become clear in the following subsections. An overview of
the methodology is depicted in \fref{methodology} and can be voiced as follows.
There are two major stages: data acquisition and data synthesis. The boxes to
the left of the two clouds in \fref{methodology} correspond to the
data-acquisition stage, and the box to the right corresponds to the
data-synthesis state. The data-acquisition stage collects and stores reference
data while the data-synthesis stage fetches these data and produces power and
temperature traces of the system. There are two types of reference data: arrival
and workload, which are referred to as patterns in the figure and in what
follows. As the names suggest, the two pieces of information characterize job
arrivals and job workloads, and they will be further discussed in the following
two subsections, \sref{traffic} and \sref{workload}. In \sref{composition}, we
explain how the pieces are combined into a coherent whole.

\subsection{Workloads} \slab{workload}

To summarize, the proposed methodology has been presented. The methodology is
composed of two stages. In the data-acquisition stage, reference arrival and
workload data are harvested. In the data-synthesis stage, the data are used to
generate a stream of jobs and subsequently compute a power and a temperature
profile. The produced data preserve the particularities of the reference data.
At the same time, the synthesis is fast as it bypasses expensive simulations.
