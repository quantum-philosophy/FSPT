In this section, we describe the workflow of our methodology and the core models
that the methodology is based on.

\subsection{Power}
\sc{McPAT} \cite{li2009}.

\subsection{Temperature}
HotSpot \cite{skadron2004}.
\sc{3D-ICE} \cite{sridhar2010}.
The solver is based on exponential integrators \cite{hochbruck2010},
