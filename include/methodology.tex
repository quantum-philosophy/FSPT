In this section, we describe the methodology that our toolchain follows. An
overview of the methodology is given in \fref{methodology} and can be summarized
as follows. There are two major stages: data acquisition and data synthesis. The
leftmost modules in \fref{methodology} correspond to the data-acquisition stage,
and the rightmost module to the data-synthesis stage. The data-acquisition stage
collects and stores reference data while the data-synthesis stage fetches these
data and produces power and temperature traces of the system. There are two
types of reference data: traffic and workload, which are referred to as
patterns. The two pieces characterize job arrivals and job workloads, and they
are to be discussed in \sref{traffic} and \sref{workload}, respectively, and to
be combined in \sref{composition}.

\subsection{Traffic} \slab{traffic}
\input{include/traffic}

\subsection{Workload} \slab{workload}
\input{include/workload}

\subsection{Composition} \slab{composition}
\input{include/composition}

To summarize, the proposed methodology has been presented. The methodology is
composed of two stages. In the data-acquisition stage, reference traffic and
workload data are harvested. In the data-synthesis stage, the data are used to
generate a stream of jobs and subsequently compute a power and a temperature
profile. The produced data preserve the particularities of the reference data.
At the same time, the synthesis is fast as it bypasses expensive simulations.
