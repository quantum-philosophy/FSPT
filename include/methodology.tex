In this section, we describe the workflow of the proposed methodology along with
the core ideas and models that the methodology is based on. Although our work is
closely related to simulation techniques, what we do is synthesis, not
simulation, which will become clear in the following subsections. An overview of
the methodology is depicted in \fref{methodology} and can be described as
follows. There are two major stages: data acquisition and data synthesis. The
leftmost modules in \fref{methodology} correspond to the data-acquisition stage,
and the rightmost module corresponds to the data-synthesis stage. The
data-acquisition stage collects and stores reference data while the
data-synthesis stage fetches these data and produces power and temperature
traces of the system. There are two types of reference data: traffic and
workload, which are referred to as patterns in the figure and in what follows.
As the names suggest, the two pieces of information characterize job arrivals
and job workloads, and they will be further discussed in \sref{traffic} and
\sref{workload}, respectively. In \sref{composition}, we shall explain how all
the pieces are combined into a coherent whole.

To summarize, the proposed methodology has been presented. The methodology is
composed of two stages. In the data-acquisition stage, reference arrival and
workload data are harvested. In the data-synthesis stage, the data are used to
generate a stream of jobs and subsequently compute a power and a temperature
profile. The produced data preserve the particularities of the reference data.
At the same time, the synthesis is fast as it bypasses expensive simulations.
