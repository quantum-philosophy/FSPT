\input{include/assets/figures/methodology}
In this section, we describe the workflow of the proposed methodology and the
core models that the methodology is based on. An overview is depicted in
\fref{methodology} and can be voiced as follows. There are two major stages:
data acquisition and data synthesis. The left-hand side of \fref{methodology}
corresponds to the former, and the right-hand one to the latter. The
data-acquisition stage collects and stores reference data while the
data-synthesis stage fetches these data and produces as much power and
temperatures data as needed. There are two types of reference data: arrival and
workload, which are referred to as patterns in the picture and in what follows.
As the names suggest, the two types the generation of job arrivals and the
corresponding workloads; they will be further discussed in the sections below,
\sref{traffic-model} and \sref{workload-model}.
