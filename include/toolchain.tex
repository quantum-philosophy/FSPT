An important part of this work is a toolchain embodying the methodology. The
toolchain has been implemented in the Rust programming language
\cite{rust}.\footnote{Rust is a systems programming developed by Mozilla
Research and thousands of independent contributors from all around the world.
Rust focuses on memory safety without garbage collection, concurrency without
data races, abstractions without overhead, and stability without stagnation.} It
consists of a number of command-line tools, and the tools are composed of a
number of stand-alone packages. The toolchain also makes use of third-party
software, including the state-of-the-art simulators introduced in
\sref{prior-work}. Regardless of the origin, each component toolchain is open
source. The code written by us is distributed under the \sc{MIT} license
\cite{mit} and is available at \cite{sources}.

The main programs of our toolchain are called Recorder and Streamer, and we
shall describe their architectures next.
