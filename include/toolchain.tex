An important part of this work is a toolchain embodying the methodology. The
toolchain has been implemented in the Rust programming language
\cite{rust}.\footnote{Rust is a systems programming language developed by
Mozilla Research and thousands of independent contributors from all around the
world. Rust provides memory safety without garbage collection, concurrency
without data races, abstractions without overhead, and stability without
stagnation.} It consists of a number of command-line tools, and the tools are
composed of a number of stand-alone packages. The toolchain also makes use of
third-party software, including the state-of-the-art simulators introduced in
\sref{prior-work}. Regardless of the origin, each component toolchain is open
source. The code written by us is distributed under the \sc{MIT} license
\cite{mit} and is available at \cite{sources}.

The main programs of our toolchain are called Recorder and Streamer, and we
shall describe their architectures in the following subsections. Before we
proceed, let us remind that collecting reference arrival data (series of arrival
times) is outside of the scope of this work (see \sref{traffic}).
