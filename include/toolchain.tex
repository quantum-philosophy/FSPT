The toolchain follows the methodology described in \sref{methodology}. It
consists of a number of command-line tools, and the tools are composed of a
number of stand-alone packages. We also make use of third-party software,
including the simulators introduced in \sref{literature}. The toolchain is
publicly available online at \cite{sources}.

The main programs of the toolchain are called \emph{Recorder} and
\emph{Streamer}, which we discuss in the following subsections.

\subsection{Recorder} \slab{recorder}
\input{include/recorder}

\subsection{Streamer} \slab{streamer}
