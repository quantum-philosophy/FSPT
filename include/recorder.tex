The Recorder tool is used at the data-acquisition stage of our methodology. More
specifically, the tool records reference workload patterns, which were discussed
in \sref{workload} and are needed for Streamer. In \fref{methodology}, Recorder
corresponds to the bottom-left boxes with the same name. The tool does not work
in isolation; there is an infrastructure around it. This infrastructure is
depicted in \fref{recorder}, in which Recorder itself is composed of the two
blue boxes on the right-hand side.

Given a reference application and a target platform, the starting point is
performance simulation, which we undertake by virtue of the Sniper simulator
\cite{carlson2011}. The output of Sniper is a series of files containing
performance-related information over time. These files are further processed by
our Recorder.

The communications between Sniper and Recorder are handled by Redis \cite{redis}
(see \fref{recorder}), which is an in-memory key-value storage commonly used for
caching and message passing. Whenever Sniper produces a new file with
performance information, it sends a message with the file's location to a Redis
queue. Recorder fetches messages from the queue (observe the diagonal arrow in
\fref{recorder}) and processes the corresponding files. There are several
aspects that are worth noting here. First, the decoupling allows Sniper and
Recorder to work asynchronously, each at its own pace. Second, there can be
multiple Recorder processes serving the same message queue. Third, there can be
many Sniper processes, each of which simulates a different program and uses a
different Redis queue. The above aspects substantially seed up the recording.

The next stop is power simulation, which we delegate to \sc{McPAT}
\cite{li2009}. \sc{McPAT} is originally a command-line program; we have made a
shared library out of it and embedded it into Recorder. Another important
modification that we have made to \sc{McPAT} is the introduction of a caching
mechanism, which was inspired by Sniper. The caching mechanism eliminates the
repetition of certain computations inside \sc{McPAT}, which leads to
considerable time savings. For caching purposes, we use Redis again; see the
direct arrows between Redis and \sc{McPAT} in \fref{recorder}. All Recorder
processes that are connected to the same Redis server can leverage the same
cache, making the caching mechanism really shine.

Finally, the computed power pattern is stored in a file, which can then be
uploaded to a repository, as described in \sref{workload} and illustrated in
\fref{methodology}. Currently, each output file is an SQLite database
\cite{sqlite}, which implies that the versatile SQL language is automatically at
one's disposal for working with the data.
