Let us now evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques. The experiments
have been conducted as following. Reference arrival data are based on a dataset
published by Google \cite{google}. The dataset contains usage data of a computer
cluster over a month period, namely, May 2011. The power patterns were obtained
by simulating applications from two widely used benchmark suites, namely, from
\sc{PARSEC} \cite{bienia2011} and \sc{SPEC CPU2006} \cite{cpu2006}.
