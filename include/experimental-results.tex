In our experiments, we use a dataset published by Google \cite{google}. The
dataset contains usage data of a computer cluster over a month period, namely,
May 2011.

In our experiments, we use power patterns obtained by simulating applications
from two widely used benchmark suites, namely, from \sc{PARSEC}
\cite{bienia2011} and \sc{SPEC CPU2006} \cite{cpu2006}.
