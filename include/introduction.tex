dissipation are of paramount importance. The two inseparable phenomena dictate
limitations on the usage of electronic devices and severely affect the costs
pertaining to the deployment and maintenance of electronic systems. Power is
essentially energy, and energy translates willingly to service times and
electricity bills. The situation is deteriorated by the fact that a higher level
of power consumption leads to higher temperatures, and higher temperatures
strike back by causing the device to consume even more power. Under these
circumstances, it is no surprise that power and temperature have been in the
limelight for a long time and have no plans on leaving this spot.

Cycle-accurate simulation is an important design tool. It is particularly useful
for the design of individual processing units; however, cycle-accurate
simulation falls short when it comes to large multiprocessor systems. Such
systems are reasonably more complex, which leads to prohibitively large, often
infeasible, simulation times. On the other hand, in order to be properly
addressed, many questions asked in both academia and industry do not need cycle
accuracy. It is important to have an adequate level of abstraction in order to
stay focused on what matters the most to the problem at hand without being
constantly destructed by insignificant or unrelated issues. In such cases, cycle
accuracy can become a serious obstacle.

Sniper raises the level of abstraction \cite{carlson2011}.
