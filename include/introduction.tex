\lettrine[findent=0.4em, nindent=0em]{\textbf{P}}{ower} consumption and heat
dissipation are of paramount importance. The two inseparable phenomena dictate
limitations on the usage of electronic devices and magnify the costs pertaining
to the deployment and maintenance of electronic systems. Power is tightly
related to energy, and energy translates willingly to hours of battery life and
to electricity bills. Operating temperature, on the other hand, is one of the
major causes of permanent damage \cite{jedec}, which necessitates the deployment
of adequate cooling equipment, escalating overall product expenses
\cite{chaudhry2015}. The situation is deteriorated further by the
power-temperature interplay: higher power leads to higher temperature, and
higher temperature strikes back by making electronic devices consume even more
power \cite{liu2007}. Under these severe circumstances, it is no surprise that
power and temperature have steadily been in the research limelight and have no
plans on leaving this spot.

In this paper, we set out to assist researchers working with power and
temperature in one specific but rather broad context. More concretely, we would
like to facilitate the development of online, data-driven, power- and
temperature-aware solutions for multiprocessor systems. Let us clarify the terms
involved in the previous statement; the approach itself will be described
shortly after. \emph{Online} refers to taking decisions at runtime, which is in
contrast to having decisions taken at design time. \emph{Data-driven} refers to
the usage of learning \cite{bishop2006}, that is, to the usage of algorithms
that learn from data as opposed to algorithms of any other kind.
\emph{Power-aware} refers to decision-making that takes into account the impact
on and the impact of power (and, therefore, energy) consumption. Similarly,
\emph{temperature-aware} refers to considering heat dissipation when taking
decisions.

We approach the outlined objective by developing a methodology for fast
synthesis of realistic power and temperature profiles. Our motivation for doing
so is described in the next section, \sref{motivation}, and here we only remark
that data-driven techniques obviously require data to learn from, and these data
might not be easily accessible to researchers for a variety of reasons, thereby
preventing research ideas from flowing freely. The goal of this work is to
eliminate this obstacle.

It is important to realize right from the start that, while artificial data
enable thoughts and ideas to evolve and ripen, the solution being developed will
eventually have to face real data. Therefore, the solution should be tested and,
if needed, calibrated in a stage environment prior to the deployment to a
production environment, which could also be done periodically at the end of a
long development cycle. The usage of synthetic data substantially speeds up the
development process due to the flexibility and fast feedback enabled by such
data, which, in particular, means that one can filter out bad ideas at early
stages and focus solely on the ones which are viable.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The motivation for embarking
on this line of research is given in \sref{motivation}.
Section~\ref{sec:prior-work} provides an overview of the prior work. In
\sref{present-work}, the contributions of the present work are summarized. The
problem that we address is formalized in \sref{problem-formulation}. The
proposed methodology is presented in \sref{methodology}. The methodology is
accompanied by a toolchain, and this toolchain is described in \sref{toolchain}.
The performance of the toolchain is evaluated in \sref{experimental-results}.
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.
