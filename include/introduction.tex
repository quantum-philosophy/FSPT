\lettrine[findent=0.3em, nindent=0em]{\textbf{P}}{ower consumption} and heat
dissipation are of great importance. Power translates to energy, and energy to
hours of battery life and to electricity bills. Temperature, on the other hand,
is one of the major causes of permanent damage \cite{jedec}, which necessitates
adequate cooling equipment and, hence, escalates product expenses
\cite{chaudhry2015}. The situation is deteriorated further by the
power-temperature interplay: higher power leads to higher temperature, and
higher temperature to higher power \cite{liu2007}. Therefore, accounting for
power and temperature is key to achieving effectiveness, efficiency, and
robustness.

The present work is to assist researchers who work with power and temperature in
one specific but rather broad context: the development of data-driven power- and
temperature-aware solutions for electronic systems; here \emph{data-driven}
refers to the usage of algorithms that learn from data \cite{bishop2006}. To
this end, we develop a toolchain for fast synthesis of realistic power and
temperature profiles. Our primary motivation is as follows.

The power and temperature characteristics of the system under development are
difficult to describe mathematically or algorithmically. Modern systems are
complex, and many aspects are inherently uncertain to the designer due to such
phenomena as process variation \cite{chandrakasan2000}, aging \cite{coskun2006},
and varying workload. The concern is particularly hard to address from the
theoretical standpoint; it can be better dealt with taking a more pragmatic
approach, namely, making use of runtime data. Assuming that the system provides
mechanisms for profiling and monitoring, direct or indirect power and
temperature readings are an invaluable source of information for making
proactive power- and temperature-aware decisions \cite{chaudhry2015,
coskun2008}.

Acting proactively requires forecasting the future by learning from the past,
which is typically accomplished by virtue of machine learning \cite{bishop2006}.
Regardless of the learning technique utilized, the technique needs data to learn
from. Real data are rarely available in large enough quantities. The target
platform might not be at one's disposal or might not be an appropriate place for
early experimentation, which is common in research. Therefore, a research
environment is typically composed of a number of computer simulators as they
constitute a feasible alternative source of the needed data. An illustration of
this scenario is given in \fref{development}, which depicts a potential
environment for developing a governor of an electronic system.

Computer simulators, however, fall short when it comes to complex systems: it
might take days for a state-of-the-art simulator to simulate a short, in
wall-clock time, program. This scheme is not affordable for designing
data-driven techniques as they require many simulations with potentially large
payloads.

To summarize, real data are rarely or sparingly available, and simulation data
are prohibitively time consuming to obtain, which hampers the development of
data-driven solutions. The need for alternative sources of high-quality data is
prominent, which brings us to the goal of this work: our objective is to provide
such a source for the case of power and temperature.

It is well understood that the solution being developed will eventually face
real data, and, therefore, it should be tested and, if it is needed, calibrated
in a stage environment prior to deploying the solution to a production
environment. The synthetic data that we generate can substantially speed up this
process due to the flexibility and fast feedback that they provided. In
particular, one can filter out inadequate ideas at early stages and focus solely
on those that are viable.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:literature}
provides an overview of the prior work. In \sref{contribution}, our
contributions are summarized. The addressed problem is formalized in
\sref{problem}. Our methodology and toolchain are presented in
\sref{methodology} and \sref{toolchain}, respectively. The experimental results
are given in \sref{result}. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.
