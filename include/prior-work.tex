Simulations can be undertaken on different levels. Cycle-accurate simulations,
for instance, are particularly useful for the design of individual processing
units; however, meticulous simulations fall short when it comes to large
multiprocessor systems \cite{carlson2011}. Such systems are reasonably more
complex, which leads to prohibitively large, often infeasible, simulation times.
On the other hand, in order to be properly addressed, many questions asked in
both academia and industry do not need cycle accuracy. It is important to have a
sufficiently high level of abstraction in order to stay focused on what matters
the most to the problem at hand without being constantly destructed by
insignificant or unrelated issues. In such cases, cycle accuracy can become a
serious obstacle.

The Sniper simulator has a higher level of abstraction \cite{carlson2011} and,
thus, more affordable simulation times.
