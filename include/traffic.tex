In order to generate realistic steams of job arrivals, we have decided to use a
multifractal wavelet model \cite{riedi1999}, which was originally proposed in
the context of network traffic modeling. In vain with other studies
\cite{nikitovic2004}. We use a dataset published by Google \cite{google}. The
dataset contains usage data of a computational cluster over a month period (May
2011).
