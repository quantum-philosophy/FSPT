As stated in \sref{problem-formulation}, the system serves a stream of jobs,
which can also be viewed as user requests. The foremost component of our
methodology is then a traffic model, describing how or, rather, when jobs
arrive. This model should satisfy a number of requirements to be practically
useful. First of all, it should be able to capture well the idiosyncrasies
present in (real) network traffic as it establishes a foundation for the further
generation of power and temperature traces. Additionally, since monitoring and
logging systems are ubiquitous now-a-days, it should be straightforward to
configure the model given a dataset of arrival times, serving as a reference.

The seminal work in \cite{leland1994} and subsequent studies have shown that
network traffic exhibits fractal properties such as burstiness, self-similarity,
and long-range dependence, which is very much unlike traditional telephone
traffic. It is well known that traffic models based on the Poisson process
\cite{lifshits2014} are unable to express any of the above properties and,
therefore, drastically departure from reality when it comes to modeling network
traffic. A step in the right direction is to consider the fractional Gaussian
noise \cite{lifshits2014}, which is a self-similar stochastic process. However,
the process is inconvenient to work with from the perspective of a computer
simulator. More concretely, the noise is suited for modeling arrivals per unit
of time but not arrival or inter-arrival times, which are what is typically
needed for simulation. Moreover, even with a proper rescaling and a positive
shift, the process can still take negative values, which is unrealistic.
Finally, the fractional Gaussian noise is a monofractal process; however, real
traffic data often have multifractal structures.

In order to address the aforementioned concerns and enable the generation of
arrival streams exhibiting fractal properties, our methodology employs a
multifractal wavelet model proposed in \cite{riedi1999}, characterizing
positive-valued data with long-range-dependent correlations. To elaborate, we
take a reference time series of arrival times, analyze it by means of the
discrete wavelet transform based on Haar wavelets, and construct a certain
representation of the data, which can then be used in order to generate random
time series matching the fractal properties of the original one. The model can
be tuned without any reference time series; however, the strength of the
technique is in the rigorous usage of reference data. By doing so, no manual
parameter tuning is needed, and the model gets tailored to the arrival pattern
of each particular problem.

In our experiments, we use a dataset published by Google \cite{google}. The
dataset contains usage data of a computer cluster over a month period, namely,
May 2011.
