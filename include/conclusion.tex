In this paper, we have emphasized the need for developing tools for the design
of electronic systems with data-driven applications in mind. We have argued that
the techniques which capitalize on learning from runtime data have special
requirements, and that the state-of-the-art simulators are unable to fulfill
them due to their prohibitively large simulation times.

Acknowledging the importance of power and temperature for the design of
electronic systems, we have developed a methodology for fast generation of power
and temperature profiles of such systems, which preserves the idiosyncrasies of
the profiles' real-life counterparts. Based on the methodology, we have
implemented a toolchain, which has then been assessed and shown to have a high
computational throughput.
