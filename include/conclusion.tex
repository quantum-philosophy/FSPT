In this paper, we emphasized the need for developing tools for studying
electronic systems with data-driven applications in mind. We argued that the
techniques capitalizing on learning from data have special requirements, and
that the state-of-the-art simulators are unable to fulfill them due to
prohibitively large simulation times. Acknowledging the importance of power and
temperature for the design of multiprocessor systems, we developed a methodology
for fast generation of synthetic power and temperature traces that preserve the
idiosyncrasies of their real-life counterparts. Last but not least, we
implemented a toolchain that embodies the presented approach, which was
subsequently assessed and shown to be extremely fast.
