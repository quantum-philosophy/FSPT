In this paper, we emphasized the need for developing tools for studying
electronic systems with data-driven applications in mind. We argued that the
techniques capitalizing on learning from data have special requirements, and
that the state-of-the-art simulators are unable to fulfill them due to
prohibitively large simulation times. Acknowledging the importance of power and
temperature for the design of multiprocessor systems, we developed a methodology
for fast generation of synthetic power and temperature traces that preserve the
idiosyncrasies of their real-life counterparts. Last but not least, we
implemented a toolchain that embodies the presented approach, which was
subsequently assessed and shown to be extremely fast.

We hope that the work presented in this paper will enable new and assist ongoing
studies by making it easier to explore the potential of novel or revived
data-demanding techniques for analysis, prediction, and management of electronic
systems.

Lastly, we would like to remind that the toolchain, repositories with reference
traffic and workload patterns, and other supplementary materials are publicly
available \cite{sources}.
