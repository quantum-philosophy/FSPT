In this paper, we have emphasized the need for developing tools for the design
of computer systems with data-driven applications in mind. We have argued that
the techniques which capitalize on learning from runtime data have special
requirements, and that the state-of-the-art simulators are unable to fulfill
them due to their prohibitively large simulation times.

Acknowledging the importance of power and temperature for the design of computer
systems, we have developed a methodology for fast generation of power and
temperature profiles of such systems, which preserve the idiosyncrasies of their
real-life counterparts. Following the methodology, we have implemented and
open sourced a toolchain, which has been assessed and shown to have a high
computational throughput.
