In this paper, we have emphasized the need for developing tools for the design
of computer systems with data-driven components. We have argued that the
techniques which capitalize on learning from runtime data have special
requirements, and that the state-of-the-art simulation tools are unable to
fulfill them due to their prohibitively large simulation times.

Acknowledging the importance of power and temperature for resource management of
computer systems, we have developed a methodology for fast generation of power
and temperature profiles of such systems, which preserve the idiosyncrasies of
their real-life counterparts. Following the methodology, we have implemented and
open sourced a toolchain, which has been assessed and shown to have a high
computational throughput.
