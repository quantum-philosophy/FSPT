Let us turn to Streamer, which corresponds to the data-synthesis stage (recall
\sref{streamer} and \fref{streamer}). Our objective in this subsection is to
study the scalability of the tool as measured by synthesis time, which is the
time that is needed for the tool to synthesize power and temperature profiles
under certain conditions or requirements. In these experiments, workload
patterns are assigned to job arrivals randomly, and a simple
first-in-first-served scheduling policy is assumed; both are the default but
easily replaceable options used by the toolchain.

The preformed experiments are consolidated in \tref{streaming}. We report our
synthesis time along two axes: synthesized time (rows) and platform size
(columns). The former is analogous to simulated time, and the latter represents
different platforms as follows. Each considered platform is composed of a number
of cores, and there is a single L3 cache for every four cores; both cores and
caches are referred to as processing elements. Platform size is defined as the
number of processing elements, and it is denoted by ``$M + N$'' in
\tref{streaming} where $M$ and $N$ are the numbers of cores and L3 caches,
respectively.

Unlike the throughput of simulation (discussed in the previous subsection), the
throughput of synthesis in terms of synthesized time is very high, which is well
supported by \tref{streaming}. To give an example, it takes Streamer around a
minute to produce power and temperature data that are worth around 17 minutes of
runtime of a computer system with 16 cores, which would be practically
infeasible to achieve with full-fledged simulations (refer to the results given
in \tref{recording}).

Another observation made from \tref{streaming} is that synthesis time scales
linearly with respect to the length of the time span being synthesized
(synthesized time), and the same can be concluded regarding the other dimension,
platform size. The growth with respect to platform size is due to the increasing
complexity of the underlying thermal \sc{RC} circuit used for temperature
simulation; thermal circuits are elaborated on in \sref{streamer}.
