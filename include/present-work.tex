Our work makes the following major contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~1.} We draw attention to the need for
  developing substantially faster simulators of electronic systems than those
  currently available in order to enable rapid exploration of advanced
  data-powered techniques for the analysis and management of such systems.

  \item {\bfseries Contribution~2.} We present a methodology for generating
  realistic power and temperature profiles of multiprocessor systems,
  addressing the above concern.

  \item {\bfseries Contribution~3.} We develop and open-source a toolchain
  implementing the proposed methodology.
\end{itemize}

The first contribution is a topic penetrating the whole paper from the
introduction to the conclusion. The other two contributions are primarily
discussed starting from the next section onward. Let us now formalize the
problem that these two contributions are supposed to solve.
