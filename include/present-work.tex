Our work makes the following major contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~1 (Attention).} We draw attention to the need
  for substantially faster simulators of electronic systems than those currently
  available in order to enable a rapid exploration of advanced data-powered
  techniques for the analysis and management of such systems.

  \item {\bfseries Contribution~2 (Methodology).} We present a methodology for
  generating realistic power and temperature profiles of multiprocessor systems,
  addressing the above concern.

  \item {\bfseries Contribution~3 (Toolchain).} We develop and open-source a
  toolchain implementing the proposed methodology.
\end{itemize}
