Our work makes the following major contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Contribution~1.} We draw attention to the need for
  substantially faster simulators of electronic systems than those currently
  available in order to enable a rapid exploration of advanced data-powered
  techniques for the analysis and management of such systems.

  \item {\bfseries Contribution~2.} We present a methodology for generating
  realistic power and temperature profiles of multiprocessor systems, addressing
  the aforementioned concern.

  \item {\bfseries Contribution~3.} We develop and open-source a toolchain
  implementing the proposed methodology.
\end{itemize}
