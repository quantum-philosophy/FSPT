We present a tool for generating realistic power and temperature traces of
multiprocessor systems with a negligible computational time. The target audience
of the tool is machine-learning-oriented studies of multiprocessor systems, in
which the availability of large amounts of data, essential for learning, is
rather elusive, to say the least. The goal of the tool is to fulfill this need,
that is, to provide abundant, representative data to learn from. Our goal is to
enable new and facilitate existing studies by making it feasible to explore
newly developed, highly promising, but data-demanding machine-learning
techniques such as artificial neural networks with deep architectures.
