We present a toolchain for fast generation of realistic power and temperature
traces of electronic systems. The target audience is researchers who develop
data-driven solutions for such systems. Examples include proactive
\mbox{power-,} \mbox{energy-,} and temperature-aware management strategies that
leverage statistics and machine learning. In this context, the availability of
sufficiently large amounts of data, which are essential for learning and, hence,
for exploration and exploitation of research ideas, is elusive. The presented
toolchain aims to fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse representative
data to learn from during development stages. The goal is to enable new studies
by making it tractable to explore the highly promising but data-demanding
state-of-the-art techniques for modeling and prediction.
