We present a toolchain for fast generation of realistic power and temperature
traces of multiprocessor systems. The target audience is the researchers who
develop data-driven solutions for such systems. Examples include proactive
\mbox{power-,} \mbox{energy-,} and temperature-aware management strategies that
leverage statistics and machine learning. In this context, the availability of
sufficiently large amounts of data, which are essential for learning and, hence,
for exploration and exploitation of research ideas, is rather elusive. The
presented toolchain aims to fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse
representative data to learn from during development stages. The overarching
goal is to enable new and facilitate existing studies by making it tractable to
explore novel or revived, highly promising, but data-demanding techniques for
modeling and prediction.
