We present a methodology and a toolchain for a rapid generation of realistic
power and temperature traces of multiprocessor systems. The target audience of
our work is research studies that leverage machine-learning techniques in order
to achieve their goals. Examples of such studies include those developing
dynamic power- and temperature-aware management strategies. In this context, the
availability of a sufficient large amount of data, which is essential for
learning and, hence, exploration of research ideas, is rather elusive, to say
the least. The presented methodology and toolchain aim to fulfill this need,
that is, to provide profuse representative data to learn from. The overarching
goal is to enable new and facilitate existing studies by making it feasible to
explore novel or revived, highly promising, but data-demanding techniques for
analysis and prediction such as artificial neural networks with deep
architectures.
