We present a toolchain for fast generation of realistic power and temperature
profiles of electronic systems. The target audience is researchers who develop
data-driven solutions for such systems. Examples include proactive
\mbox{power-,} \mbox{energy-,} and temperature-aware management strategies that
leverage machine-learning techniques. In this context, the availability of
sufficiently large amounts of data, which are essential for learning and,
therefore, for exploration of research ideas, is elusive. The presented
toolchain aims to fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse representative
data to learn from during development stages. The goal is to facilitate research
by making it tractable to experiment with the highly promising but
data-demanding state-of-the-art techniques for modeling and prediction.
