We present a methodology and a toolchain for the rapid generation of realistic
power and temperature traces of multiprocessor systems. The target audience of
this work is researchers who develop on-chip solutions that internally rely on
data-driven techniques in order to attain their objectives. Examples of use
cases include proactive power-, energy-, and temperature-aware management
strategies that leverage various machine-learning techniques. In this context,
the availability of a sufficiently large amount of data, which is essential for
learning and prediction and, consequently, for the exploration and exploitation
of research ideas, is rather elusive, to say the least. The presented
methodology and toolchain aim to fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse
representative data to learn from at the development stage. The overarching goal
is to enable new and facilitate existing studies by making it tractable to
explore novel or revived, highly promising, but potentially data-demanding
techniques for modeling and prediction.
