We present a toolchain for fast generation of realistic power and temperature
profiles of computer systems. The target audience is researchers who develop
data-driven solutions for such systems. Examples include proactive \mbox{power-}
and temperature-aware management strategies leveraging machine learning in order
to attain their objectives. In this context, the availability of sufficiently
large amounts of relevant data, which are essential for learning and, hence,
exploration of research ideas, is elusive. The toolchain aims to fulfill this
need, that is, to provide profuse representative data to learn from during
development stages. Our goal is to facilitate research by making it tractable to
experiment with the highly promising but data-demanding state-of-the-art
techniques for modeling and prediction.
