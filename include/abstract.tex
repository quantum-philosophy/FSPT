We present a toolchain for a rapid generation of realistic power and temperature
traces of multiprocessor systems. The target audience of the toolchain is
research studies that leverage learning techniques in order to achieve their
goals such as those developing dynamic power- and temperature-aware management
strategies. In this context, the availability of sufficient large amounts of
data---which are essential for learning and, hence, exploration of research
ideas---is rather elusive, to say the least. The presented toolchain aims to
fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse representative data to learn
from. The overarching goal is to enable new and facilitate existing studies by
making it feasible to explore novel or revived, highly promising, but
data-demanding techniques for analysis and prediction such as artificial neural
networks with deep architectures.
