We present a methodology and a toolchain for a rapid generation of realistic
power and temperature traces of multiprocessor systems. The target audience of
this work is researchers who develop on-chip solutions that internally rely on
machine-learning techniques in order to attain their objectives. Examples of
such studies include those working on proactive power-, energy-, and
temperature-aware management strategies. In this context, the availability of a
sufficiently large amount of data, which is essential for learning and,
consequently, for the exploration and exploitation of research ideas, is rather
elusive, to say the least. The presented methodology and toolchain aim to
fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse representative data to learn from
at the development stage. The overarching goal is to enable new and facilitate
existing studies by making it tractable to explore novel or revived, highly
promising, but potentially data-demanding techniques for modeling and prediction
such as artificial neural networks with deep architectures.
