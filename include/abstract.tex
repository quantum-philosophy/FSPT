We present a methodology and a toolchain for rapid generation of realistic power
and temperature traces of multiprocessor systems. The target audience of this
work comprises researchers who develop online solutions that internally rely on
data-driven techniques in order to attain their objectives. Examples of use
cases include proactive power-, \mbox{energy-,} and temperature-aware management
strategies that leverage tools from statistics and machine learning. In this
context, the availability of a sufficiently large amount of data, which is
essential for learning and, consequently, for exploration and exploitation of
research ideas, is rather elusive, to say the least. The presented methodology
and toolchain aim to fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse
representative data to learn from during development stages. The overarching
goal is to enable new and facilitate existing studies by making it tractable to
explore novel or revived, highly promising, but potentially data-demanding
techniques for modeling and prediction.
