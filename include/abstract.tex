We present a software framework for a rapid generation of realistic power and
temperature traces of multiprocessor systems. The target audience of the
framework is research studies that leverage learning techniques in order to
achieve their goals such as those developing dynamic power- and
temperature-aware management strategies. In this context, the availability of
sufficient large amounts of data---which are essential for learning and, hence,
exploration of research ideas---is rather elusive, to say the least. The
presented framework aims to fulfill this need, that is, to provide profuse
representative data to learn from. The overarching goal is to enable new and
facilitate existing studies by making it feasible to explore novel or revived,
highly promising, but data-demanding techniques for data analysis and prediction
such as artificial neural networks with deep architectures.
