In this paper, we present a tool for generating realistic power and temperature
traces of multiprocessor systems in large quantities at negligible computational
costs. The primary target audience of the tool is machine-learning-oriented
studies of multiprocessor systems, in which the availability of large amounts of
data, essential for learning, is rather elusive, to say the least. The goal of
the tool is to fulfill this need, that is, to provide abundant, representative
data to learn from. Our hope is to engender new and facilitate existing studies
of the aforementioned kind by providing them with the material needed for the
exploration of the highly promising but data demanding machine-learning
techniques such as deep neural networks.
