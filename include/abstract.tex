The goal of this work is to facilitate the development of proactive
\mbox{power-} and temperature-aware resource managers that leverage machine
learning in order to attain their objectives. In this context, the availability
of sufficiently large amounts of relevant data, which are essential for learning
and, therefore, exploration of research ideas, is elusive. In order to fulfill
the need, we present a toolchain for fast generation of realistic power and
temperature profiles of computer systems. The toolchain provides profuse
representative data to learn from during development stages. The overreaching
goal is to help research by making it tractable to experiment with the highly
promising but data-demanding state-of-the-art for modeling and prediction.
