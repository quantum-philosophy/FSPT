\input{include/assets/figures/streamer}
\streamer\ is responsible for generating power and temperature data. The
streaming infrastructure is depicted in \fref{streamer}.

The construction of thermal circuits is delegated to \sc{3D-ICE}
\cite{sridhar2010}; HotSpot \cite{skadron2004} is an alternative.

The actual temperature analysis is undertaken by means of a solver based on
exponential integrators \cite{hochbruck2010}, \cite{ukhov2012}.
