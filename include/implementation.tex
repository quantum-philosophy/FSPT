The toolchain has been implemented in the Rust programming language
\cite{rust}.\footnote{Rust is a systems programming developed by Mozilla
Research and thousands of independent contributors from all around the world.
Rust focuses on memory safety without garbage collection, concurrency without
data races, abstractions without overhead, and stability without stagnation.} It
consists of a number of programs, and the programs are composed of a number of
stand-alone packages. The toolchain also makes use of third-party software.
Regardless of the origin, each component of the toolchain is open source. The
code written by us is distributed under the \sc{MIT} license \cite{mit} and is
available at \cite{sources}. Feedback is welcome, and contribution will be very
much appreciated.

The main programs of our toolchain are called \recorder\ and \streamer, and we
shall describe them next.

\subsection{Recorder}

As the name suggests, the purpose of \recorder\ is recording. More specifically,
the tool records power traces, which are needed as an input to \streamer.

The key-value storage is Redis \cite{redis}. The database is SQLite
\cite{sqlite}.

\subsection{Streamer}
