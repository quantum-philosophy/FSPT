The tool has been implemented in the Rust programming language
\cite{rust}.\footnote{Rust is a systems programming developed by Mozilla
Research together with thousands of independent contributors from all around the
world. Rust features memory safety without garbage collection, concurrency
without data races, abstractions without overhead, and stability without
stagnation.} The tool is composed of a number of independent packages, which can
be used on their own. The source code of all the components is distributed under
the \sc{MIT} license and is available online \cite{sources}.

The key-value storage is Redis \cite{redis}. The database is SQLite
\cite{sqlite}.
