Consider an in-design or in-use electronic system. The system is composed of a
number of processing elements and is capable of performing a number of
operations. The system receives a stream of requests or jobs, which it is
supposed to process. Each job implies a certain amount of work to be done and,
therefore, a certain amount of power/energy to be consumed and a certain amount
of heat to be dissipated. An example of such a system is a member of a computer
cluster.

Consider now a hypothetical project targeted at developing a management policy
for the system at hand. Since the importance of power and temperature is well
understood, which is motivated in \sref{introduction}, the policy is required to
take into account the two quantities. Suppose further that the solution is to be
based on learning from power and temperature data.

Our goal is to develop a methodology for generating power and temperature traces
and a toolchain embodying it. The requirements are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Requirement~1 (Realism).}

  \item {\bfseries Requirement~2 (Speed).}
\end{itemize}
